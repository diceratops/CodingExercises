This repository is meant as a place to keep up
with the coding exercises I'm doing to learn
better coding practice. I'll probably use them for
pair programming days for the LadiesProgrammingClub as well.
It will likely be, Ruby, Io, Java, and Closure based. 

Remember to have fun, and take some advice from a linguist:

"Critical and creative thinking may be viewed
academically as unique mental activities, in which individuals
can be deficient, but the elements of thinking critically and creatively
are in everyone's behavioral and cognitive repertoire.
People may often not appear to be thinking critically
or creatively because they are often not in situations
that permit or call for criticism or creativity, or because
they are not disposed to behave critically or
creatively in such situations. This does not mean
that some individuals are totally incapable of
thinking critically or creatively, or that they
lack training. It is just that they are
not thinking in those ways, for one reason or another."
- Frank Smith, To Think pg. 102.
